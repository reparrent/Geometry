This program calculates midpoint and length of
3D or 2D line segement, and also slope of 2D
line segment. 
Currently, only the CLI version is operational.
The GUI version built in main.py doesn't really
work yet and will be abandoned.  I need to 
learn the details of the GUI development using 
the tkinter library.
